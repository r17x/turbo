# Roadmap

We've got big plans for Turbopack. Here's what we're aiming for in the future:

## Next.js

### Short term

Our short term goal is an improved local development experience for Next.js to allow to enable a faster development iteration cycle.

- Reach parity with the existing Next.js dev server feature set, e. g.
  - PostCSS and Tailwind,
  - next/image, next/dynamic, @next/font, next/script,
  - URL imports, `new URL()`, MDX,
  - Streaming of React Server Components, `getStaticPaths`, 404 page, custom error page,
  - Internationalization.
- Support configuration from `next.config.js` and `jsconfig.json`.
- Enable reliable HMR for everything:
  - `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`,
  - Server Components,
  - `_app` and `_document`,
  - `next.config.js`.
- Add partial support for `next build`.

### Mid term

Our mid term goal is to improve the performance of preview and production builds to allow to ship faster.

- Reach parity with the existing `next build` feature set.
- Port popular Next.js plugins to Turbopack.
- Allow to test production builds with `next dev`.

### Long term

Our long term vision is to enable an improved experience for every user.

- Make Turbopack the default for `next dev` and `next build`, falling back to webpack when a webpack configuration is detected in `next.config.js`.
- Working with user and plugin authors to reduce blockers for Turbopack adoption.

## Turbopack

### Short term

Our short term goal is to reduce the coupling between Turbopack and Next.js to open Turbopack to other frameworks.

- Move Next.js support into a framework plugin.
  - Each framework should be an equal first-class citizen.
- Offer a turbopack configuration and plugin API for advanced usage outside of Next.js.
  - Document when and how users can migrate from webpack to Turbopack.

### Mid term

Our mid term goal is to expand the scope of Turbopack beyond Next.js to bring to bring its benefits to other frameworks.

- Start adding support for more frameworks e. g. webpack, Svelte, Vue, Angular, etc.
  - Work with authors to achieve the best integration experience.
- Add support for persistent caching on disk.
  - This is also a requirement for `next build` support.

### Long term

Our long term vision is to make every build instant.

- Add support for remote caching.

## Developer Experience

### Short term

Our short term goal is to bring Next.js goodies to all Turbopack powered frameworks.

- Move error overlay from Next.js to Turbopack.
- Integrate typechecking and linting.

### Mid term

Our mid term goal is to overhaul the in-browser UI and introspection capabilities to make available information more accessible.

- Improve error overlay.
- Offer more in-browser dev tools.

### Long term

Our long term vision is to offer a world-class developer experience.

- Further improve on observability and introspection.
